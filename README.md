This is a java project created using a software called Processing. 

Here I have created a project that draws shapes onto the screen, a shape is created for every frame and is drawn on the location of the mouse. 

Additionally, the shape changes colour each time any key or button is pressed, and the rotation of the two shapes also changes on each frame.
